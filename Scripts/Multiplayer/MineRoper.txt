Thanks for downloading the MineRoper script!
The instructions displayed when the game starts will get you running in no time,
but the script allows for customization, which is explained here.
If you want to fork it on GitHub, you can do so at:
https://github.com/cerosrhino/hedgewars-scripts

To customize gameplay while hosting a game, you need to copy the Shoppa scheme
first and enter the in-game scheme editor.

Currently, you can adjust the count of bullets a player has initially,
ranging from 1 to 6, 5 being the default value.
In the scheme editor, the mine count field is what determines this.

You can also set the fuse time (how long a mine/bullet takes to explode),
by applying a combination of custom settings for the mine timeout and the mine
dud percentage (the mine timeout determines the base value, which is then
multiplied by the percentage; a percentage of 0% behaves as if it were set
to 100%, thus having the unmodified base value take effect).

You might also be interested in changing the turn time (which is a generic
setting that has no influence on how the script behaves). 30 seconds is
the default time for Shoppa scheme, but I found 15 seconds to be interesting.

NOTE: In order of any of your custom settings to work, the mine count
must be set to a non-zero value!

Enjoy!
